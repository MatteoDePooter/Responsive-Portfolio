# Responsive-Portfolio
I have worked on this website in my class only for over 4 weeks now(27/02/2025).
Throughout my working on this website I have also learned how github works just a little bit for uploading my site etc... . I have learned that it is a weird app for uploading already written scripts into it. Because when I did my site looked nothing like it when I booted my site via Visual Studio Code's go live button.
I have learned nothing new except for a little bit of Javascript to make my navigation and my in touch section.
